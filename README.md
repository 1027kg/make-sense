## Description

[makesense.ai][1] is a free to use online tool for labelling photos. Thanks to the use of a browser it does not require any complicated installation - just visit the website and you are ready to go. It also doesn't matter which operating system you're running on - we do our best to be truly cross-platform. It is perfect for small computer vision deeplearning projects, making the process of preparing a dataset much easier and faster. Prepared labels can be downloaded  in one of multiple supported formats. The application was written in TypeScript and is based on React/Redux duo.

## Road Map

Our application is being actively developed. If you have an idea for a new functionality, please hit us on [Twitter][3] or create an issue where you can describe your concept. In the meantime, see what improvements we are planning for you in the future.

* Optimization of the process of loading photos from disk - queuing 
* Labelling objects using polygons and BÃ©zier curves
* Export labels in COCO JSON format
* Separate tab with settings
* Support basic image operations like crop and resize
* Converting video to image frames
* Keyboard shortcuts to improve productivity 
* Automatic detection of objects in a photo - all you have to do is to label them

## Supported Output Formats

* A .zip package containing files in YOLO format

<details><summary><i>example of file in YOLO format</i></summary><p>

`label_index rel_rect_center_x rel_rect_center_y rel_rect_width rel_rect_height`  
`label_index` - index of the selected label  
`rel_rect_center_x` - horizontal position of the centre of the rect in relation to overall image width  
`rel_rect_center_y` - vertical position of the centre of the rect in relation to overall image height  
`rel_rect_width` - rect width in relation to overall image width  
`rel_rect_height` - rect height in relation to overall image height
