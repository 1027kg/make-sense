## Description

[makesense.ai][1] is a free to use online tool for labelling photos. Thanks to the use of a browser it does not require any complicated installation - just visit the website and you are ready to go. It also doesn't matter which operating system you're running on - we do our best to be truly cross-platform. It is perfect for small computer vision deeploearning projects, making the process of preparing a dataset much easier and faster. Prepared labels can be downloaded  in one of multiple supported formats. The application was written in TypeScript and is based on React/Redux duo.

## Road Map
